CrossFi Chain — is a layer 1 blockchain with a modular architecture. It consists of two integral parts, Cosmos and EVM. Each part is responsible for its specific functionality, with their work completely synchronized as a single organism.
The overall testnet program is expected to last ~3 months:

For validators: 3 months
For developers: 2 months
For users: 2.5 months
1.18% of the total supply is allocated for rewards for users.
